This project is not meant to be used in real world, its just a prototype of an idea,
supposed to show and expand my programming knowledge.
## Overview 
A unified place to view investment portfolio from many platforms, it being stocks or cryptocurrency.

Website should have:
1. User registration and login (perhaps with some account management features)
2. Simple, modern looking landing page
3. Page for authorized users for managing their API keys, which are used for communication with the platforms
4. Page for viewing data that can be gathered using those API keys, this wil be displayed in draggable elements, which content can be somewhat modified
e.g. Pie chart for portfolio value across all platforms or each draggable element for its own platform etc. 
5. Page for finding price differences for owned assets between specified time period (to show potential 'discounts')

API keys will be used for read only.
